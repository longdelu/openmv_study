  * @date      31-March-2017
  * @brief     Based on STM32F103xE's startup file.
  *            This module performs:
  *                - Set the initial SP
  *                - Set the initial PC == Reset_Handler,
  *                - Set the vector table entries with the exceptions ISR address
  *                - Configure the clock system
  *                - Configure external SRAM mounted on STM3210E-EVAL board
  *                  to be used as data memory (optional, to be enabled by user)
  *                - Branches to entry in the C library (which eventually
  *                  calls main(), but entry() in RT-Thread).
  *            After Reset the Cortex-M3 processor is in Thread mode,
  *            priority is Privileged, and the Stack is set to Main.
