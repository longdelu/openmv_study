# Multi Color Blob Tracking Example

# This example shows off multi color blob tracking using the OpenMV Cam.

# Color Tracking Thresholds (L Min, L Max, A Min, A Max, B Min, B Max)
# The below thresholds track in general red/green things. You may wish to tune them...
thresholds = [(30, 100, 15, 127, 15, 127), # generic_red_thresholds
              (30, 100, -64, -8, -32, 32), # generic_green_thresholds
              (0, 15, 0, 40, -80, -20)] # generic_blue_thresholds
# You may pass up to 16 thresholds above. However, it's not really possible to segment any
# scene with 16 thresholds before color thresholds start to overlap heavily.

# Only blobs that with more pixels than "pixel_threshold" and more area than "area_threshold" are
# returned by "find_blobs" below. Change "pixels_threshold" and "area_threshold" if you change the
# camera resolution. Don't set "merge=True" becuase that will merge blobs which we don't want here.
